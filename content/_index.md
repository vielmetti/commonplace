# Commonplace book

A commonplace book is a place to copy in things
that you want to keep close to you, rather than
necessarily original work.

This is organized
two levels deep, one top level is the
major level, the next one down is chapter
by chapter. This keeps individual sections
a reasonable size.

I got tired of the blog format, where
everything I wrote scrolled off the page.
This structure at least allows some
chance that "old" things won't be totally lost.

At the moment, this web site can be reached
as [https://emv-commonplace.netlify.app] on Netlify,
a continuous deployment platform with native support
for Hugo.

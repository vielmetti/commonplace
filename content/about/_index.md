Ed Vielmetti is an Internet veteran with over 30 years experience.

Ed has extensive experience with networks at all levels - physical,
logical, technical, social, political, and financial.  He is a graduate
of the University of Michigan, and an alumnus of Cisco Systems and
Arbor Networks.

At Packet, Ed leads outreach to a wide variety of software ecosystems,
from open source to the Enterprise.   His main project is Works On Arm,
which helps to bring cloud native and data center software to 64-bit Arm
servers.

When he's not opening issues on Github, Ed can be found on the amateur
radio bands as W8EMV, tinkering with a pile of Raspberry Pis, or coworking
at Ann Arbor's Workantile.

title: Tampa Bay Rays
---
The Tampa Bay Rays flagship station is 620 [WDAE] in St Petersburg, Florida. There
are no current SDRs available in the Tampa Bay area for the 2019 baseball season.
WDAE's signal is too weak by the time it gets south to Miami or Key West to make
it over the stronger Radio Rebelde (though you can hear the unmistakable sounds
of baseball underneath).

A map of the [Rays Radio Network] might suggest some alternatives, such as
[WJBX] 770 Fort Meyers, or perhaps [WKII] 1070 Port Charlotte.

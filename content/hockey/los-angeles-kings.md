title: Los Angeles Kings

The LA Kings hockey can be found on
[iHeartRadio](https://www.iheart.com/live/la-kings-audio-network-8013/)
online on the "LA Kings Audio Network".
Nick Nickson and Daryl Evans call the games.

It's unclear at the moment just how much
broadcast radio coverage they have on a regular basis,
after a [2018 agreement] with iHeartMedia
that moved them off of AM radio.

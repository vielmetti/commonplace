title: Netlify

[Netlify] is a content distribution network (CDN)
and site building tool. It is used here to take
the Hugo site in this repository and serve it
up on the site
[emv-commonplace.netlify.app](https://emv-commonplace.netlify.app/).

Hugo has instructions for [hosting on Netlify]
with a bunch of options you can set. If memory
serves, this was easy enough to do with the
default settings that it just works. I'm not
using many of the Hugo features, nor any of the
special Netlify features, so perhaps there will
be an opportunity to revisit this.

The particular instance running now is pinned to
an old version of Hugo. That will certainly cause
problems in some future as Hugo changes from version
to version.

title: Tailscale VPN
---
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) is the VPN I use
to keep track of all of the computers on my local
and wide area networks. It runs on MacOS, my Pi's
and Jetson Nano, and on a couple of temporary servers
in the cloud. When we're out of lockdown, I'm expecting
to also set it up running on a Pi at Workantile so
that I have ready access there as well.

Unlike most VPNs that act as proxies to the greater
Internet, Tailscale really helps you care
for and extend your trusted LAN.

Free for single-user use on whatever collection of
computers you have for it.

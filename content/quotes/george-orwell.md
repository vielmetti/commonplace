> Behind Winston’s back the voice from the telescreen was still
babbling away about pig iron and the overfulfillment of the Ninth
Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously.
Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper,
would be picked up by it; moreover, so long as he remained within
the field of vision which the metal plate commanded, he could be
seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether
you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what
system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was
guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all
the time. but at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever
they wanted to. You have to live – did live, from habit that became
instinct – in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard,
and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.

from 1984

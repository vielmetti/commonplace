[KLAA 830] is the home station of the Los Angeles Angels.
The Twitter feed is from [@AngelsRadioKLAA]. Pick it up
on a KiwiSDR [Token Radio] in the Mojave Desert, or
KiwiSDR [AK7V] in Wrightwood, CA, or
KiwiSDR [W6FNO] at Elsinore Peak, or
KiwiSDR [KA9Q] in San Diego. The transmitter is
in Chino, CA, about 45 miles west of downtown LA.

The Los Angeles radio spectrum is very busy, and
the LA radio market covers a lot of area. The station
runs on reduced power (20000 watts) at night, to
protect clear-channel [WCCO] Minneapolis.

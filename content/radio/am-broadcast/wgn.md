WGN 720 broadcasts Chicago Blackhawks hockey and Chicago White Sox
baseball (since 2018).

Listen via a nearby KiwiSDR in [Elida, OH](http://65.29.112.189:8073/?f=720.00amz10),
but really, nearly every SDR in the midwest can pick up WGN on a good night.
50,000 watts clear channel.

A very good station for Chicago
area baseball broadcasts is [K9MQ] in northwestern Indiana.

[White Sox news] is on the WGN website, but as per
normal Major League Baseball rules, the site does
not carry live regular season games.

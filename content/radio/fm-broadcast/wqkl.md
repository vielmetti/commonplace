WQKL is "Ann Arbor's 107one".

This station has such a strong signal to my home
that I can pick it up on the FM tuner on my Android
phone without any external antenna. A Cumulus station,
playing a middle-of-the-road mix of tunes most of the
time ("adult album alternative").

Some shows worth noting:

Martin Bandyke's "Fine Tuning" is two hours of freeform
radio, Sundays from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.

"Sonic Bliss" is three non-stop hours of trip hop, dream pop,
ambient, and world grooves, Sundays from 9:00 p.m. to midnight.

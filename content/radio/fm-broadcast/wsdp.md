High school radio from the Plymouth-Canton Public Schools,
playing today's music. Since the signal collides with WCBN-FM
88.3 Ann Arbor both stations have to adjust their broadcast
footprint to accomodate the other.

Driving from Ann Arbor to Plymouth, the usual spot where
one station is reachable and the other is not is about
Beck Road (M-14 Exit 18).

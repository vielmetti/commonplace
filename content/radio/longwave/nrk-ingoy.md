[NRK Ingøy](http://www.dxing.info/profiles/norway_nrk_ingoy.dx) transmitteed
the [NRK P1](https://radio.nrk.no/direkte/p1) feed
on 153 Khz from a remote output in northern Norway, until
the service's shutdown in December 2019.

We listened via the nearby [ArcticSDR](http://arcticsdr.ddns.net:8073/)
which got a very strong signal. 
That SDR is still up for your far-northern listening needs,
but the signal is no more.

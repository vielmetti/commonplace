[K3FEF] and W3TKP run a WebSDR in Milford, PA
with good coverage of the northeastern US.
Up to 50 simultaneous listeners make this
a good first choice for stations from Boston
to New York to Washington.

The WebSDR software doesn't have an easy
way to dial in to a specific frequency,
so you'll have to tune once you connect.

title: Radio Austria (OE1)
---
Nightly broadcast in German from [OE1](https://oe1.orf.at/).
Radio Austria International is off the air as such, but from
0600-0720 (1:00 a.m. to 2:20 a.m. Eastern) or so there's
a shortwave broadcast of this Austrian program. Pick it up via
the [KiwiSDR I1cra](http://kiwisdr.briata.org:8073/?f=6155.00amz10)
in Italy on 6155 KHz.

Programs have features, interviews, and music, plus a little news.
The times I've heard it have focused on classical music.

The [OE1 player](https://oe1.orf.at/player/live) is very nice, and
lets you rewind back to recent shows and see what's playing now
with a lovely interface.

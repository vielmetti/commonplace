[Radio Havana Cuba] broadcasts to North America on 6000 KHz
evenings with a one hour program that is repeated throughout
the evening. There is also a Spanish language broadcast on 6060
KHz. Both feature Cuban music, news from Cuba and the world,
and programs like Arnie Coro's DX's Unlimited.

Listen on shortwave via [NO2CW] Hollywood (Miami) FL, 242 miles
northeast of Havana, or pick up a signal via the [K3FEF] WebSDR
in Milford, PA which can handle dozens of listeners.

The R Havana signal propogates well across the Eastern and Midwestern US,
so really, if you can tune to any SDR anywhere you should try to pick it up.

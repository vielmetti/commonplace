title: SDR.HU (project ended)
---
SDR.HU was a directory an international network of software-defined radio
receivers, each of which can be tuned by several (generally four)
people across a wide band of spectrum. Many of the SDR.HU
sites are running KiwiSDR.

The projet ended in May 2020, and the best KiwiSDR directory now
is at [kiwisdr.com/public](http://kiwisdr.com/public/).

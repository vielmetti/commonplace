The [Hurricane Watch Net](https://hwn.org/)
main web site is on [hwn.org](https://hwn.org/).

The primary mission of the Hurricane Watch Net
is to disseminate tropical cyclone advisory information to
island communities in the Caribbean, Central America,
along the Atlantic seaboard of the U.S.,
and throughout the Gulf of Mexico coastal areas.
We also collect observed or measured weather data from
amateur radio operators in the storm affected area
as well as any post storm damage,
and convey that information to the Hurricane Forecasters
in the National Hurricane Center
via the amateur radio station in the center (WX4NHC).

When activated, you will find us on
14.325 MHz (USB) by day and 7.268 MHz (LSB) by night.
If propagation dictates, daytime operations will be conducted
on both frequencies simultaneously.

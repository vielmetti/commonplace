# Nana's Beer Stew recipe

From Tish Osborn- Originally from Ada Vielmetti (Nana) & Aunt Florence Burt

To serve @ 6 people, use:

* 4 lbs. Of good Stew Meat
* 2 lb. Onions, thickly sliced
* Flour to dredge meat
* Oil to brown meat, in a large skillet
* 6 cloves of garlic, finely chopped or crushed
* 3T Dark Brown Sugar
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
* 2 small bay leaves, put in whole
* 1 t. dried thyme leaves..... Or 2 tsps. of fresh
* 1 T. salt
* Freshly ground black pepper to taste
* 2 bottles of GOOD beer. I often use English Stout
* 2 10 1/2 oz cans of Beef Broth (not Consume')

(Dumpling mix: recipe below, put on at end of cooking time.)

Cut beef into bite-size pieces. Dredge in flour and brown in skillet
with a little oil, before putting in an ovenproof casserole dish. (I
use a large roaster.)

When all beef has been browned, add a little more oil, and saute
onion and garlic just until soft.

Add the onion and garlic to the casserole with the meat; except beer
and broth.

Mix well.

Add broth to skillet to de-glaze pan. Add all other ingredients,
and stir to make sure sugar is dissolved. Pour over meat mixture and
stir again.

Add beer. Stir all together.

Cover casserole and cook at 325 degrees for @ 2-3 hours.

Note: The stew will appear to be very runny. The dumplings seem to
absorb some of the liquid.

Mix dumplings together just before you are ready to serve stew. Drop
spoon dumplings on top of meat, put the lid back on the casserole and
bake for 15 minutes without lifting lid.

Serve, and expect accolades.

I often just mix up Bisquick dumplings....but here's the original
recipe.

## Optional Dumpling recipe

* 2 cups sifted self-rising flour
* 3/4 cup of milk
* 2T. Melted butter
* A little chopped parsley if you like, for flavor.

Mix together and drop on the stew. Cook 15 min as directed.

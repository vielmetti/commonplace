title: Asparagus cheese toast
---
This makes a nice summer supper.

For the cheese sauce: melt some butter. Brown some
flour in with the butter. Add milk, stir briskly until
thickened. Add some of your favorite grated cheese -
this time it was from a big block of orange cheddar.
Season with salt and pepper and perhaps a bit of
yellow mustard.

For the hard boiled eggs: bring to a boil, remove
from heat, let sit 12 minutes or until at desired
doneness.

For the asparagus: wash, trim the ends, cut into two
inch pieces. Boil a pan of water. Put the asparagus
into the boiling water for three minutes, then drain
(the water will be light green).

For the toast: get the nicest bread you can and toast it!

Assemble in layers - toast, asparagus, egg cut to pieces,
then some cheese sauce on top.

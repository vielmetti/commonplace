frozen chicken in the instant pot until done. 
Heat up a big pan, fry the spice mix in a little
oil, add chicken. Pull the chicken until it's in
shreds. Add reserved cooking liquid if too dry.

Serve with taco shells, tortillas, lettuce,
tomato, cucumber, shredded cheese, and salsa.

About 1.5 lbs chicken (half a freezer bag) serves 4.

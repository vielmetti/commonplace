This recipe is good for those days when you have dinner that might
be postponed for a long time. The curry can be served quickly, but
if you leave it on the stove longer the potatoes turn into a kind
of delicious curry gravy for the garbanzos. We served it with greens,
and it would have been good with a side of cauliflower as well.

Coconut-potato curry.

2-3 lbs potatoes, boiled, with 1 cup cooking water reserved
1 onion, chopped
Oil for frying
curry powder, to taste
1 can coconut milk
2 cans garbanzo beans, cooked and drained and rinsed

Prepare potatoes by boiling them until done. Reserve some cooking
water.

While the potatoes are boiling, fry a chopped onion in some oil on
low heat. When the onion smells nice but is not brown, add the curry
powder and cook, stirring, until fragrant.

Add the coconut milk to the curry mixture and stir until well mixed.
Then add the garbanzoes, and cook covered on low heat.

When the potatoes are ready, add them to the garbanzo curry. Cut
the potatoes into smaller pieces if they are too large. Keep covered,
and add up to 1 cup potato water if the mixture gets too dry.

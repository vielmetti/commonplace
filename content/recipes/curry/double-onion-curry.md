Chicken with double onion curry is a company-worthy dish.
I served it on Mothers Day 2016.
It takes too long to make it a routine dish, but it's quite delicious.

The recipe is in Saveur, I think, or on my blog.

The double onions are sauteed rings (20 min) and a fried onion
ginger garlic paste (10 min).  Production would be faster if you
cooked the double onions simultaneously.

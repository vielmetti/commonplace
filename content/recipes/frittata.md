title: Frittata
---
Good for using up vegetables.

Saute green onions or garlic in a big frying pan. Add cooked
vegetables (asparagus e.g. or chard) or fresh green (e.g. spinach). 

Pour in six or seven beaten
eggs. If you have the time, 
separate out the eggs and beat
the whites for a fluffier frittata.

I'm told that the secret ingredient for the
Morgan and York frittata is crumbled potato
chips, left to soak up the egg mixture.

Top with parsley, sun-dried tomatoes, olives.

Cook over medium heat (6 or 7) until done; cover at the
end to get the top fully set. Sprinkle grated 
cheese over the top near the end of cooking, it
will melt from the hot frittata. If desired,
put the pan under a broiler at the end to toast
the cheese.

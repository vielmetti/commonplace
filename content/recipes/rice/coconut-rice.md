title: Coconut rice
---
For the rice: cook rice the night before, cool. Using a big
pot, put the rice in with a can of coconut milk or cream and
a little water. Heat until warmed and the rice has absorbed
some of the coconut.

For the veg: cook onions and garlic with cumin powder and
dry mustard. Toast cashews. Rinse and drain a can of garbanzos.
Cut a few cups of spinach into ribbons. Wilt the spinach
with the onions. Add the cashews and garbanzos. Stir until
heated through.

Mix everything together. Serve with chopped cilantro and
a side of steamed broccoli.

Makes a lot.

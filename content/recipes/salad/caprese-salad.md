title: Caprese salad
---
Buy fresh tomatoes at market, and fresh basil too.
The mozazrella should be the fresh type and not the
dried type, either in a big log or in little balls.

For the dressing: wash and dry some basil. Heat
some olive oil, fry the basil in the oil. Take off
the heat.

For the salad: a layer of sliced tomatoes, a layer
of slices of fresh mozzarella, some fresh basil,
then the fried basil dressing. Season generously
with salt and fresh ground pepper.

This is a summertime dish only, do not try it with
winter tomatoes.

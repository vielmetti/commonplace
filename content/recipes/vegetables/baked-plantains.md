Ingredients

2 Ripe plantains
1 Tbsp Coconut oil
Sea salt to taste

Instructions

Cut plantains in half lengthwise, remove skin and then cut into oblong chunks.

Lightly toss slices of very ripe plantain with coconut oil with a
little sea salt and cover in a roasting pan with tin foil.

Cook low on 320f degrees for approx. 20 minutes.

Then, remove the cover (the plantains will be a little puffy and
very soft), crank up the heat to 420f degrees for 15 minutes or so,
watch them and they're done when you're happy with the color! I
like mine dark!

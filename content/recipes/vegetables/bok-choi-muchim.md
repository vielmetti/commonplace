title: Bok choi muchim
---
This bok choi dish is seasoned with gochujang and doenjang (soybean paste).
I follow a recipe from [Maangchi](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/bok-choy-muchim).

Blanch the baby bok choi for 3 minutes in boiling water.
Remove from the blanching water, refresh under cold water,
and squeeze out any excess water.

Combine garlic, green onion, doenjang (soybean paste), gochujang
(red pepper paste), sugar, and toasted
sesame oil in a bowl and mix.

Mix the sauce with the bok choi, sprinkle with
toasted sesame seeds. Serve with rice.

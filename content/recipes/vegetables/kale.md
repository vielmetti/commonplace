Saute garlic in oil. Chop kale fine, trimming tough stems. Fry until
bright green. Turn off heat, cover and let sit until wilted. Serve
warm.

Alternative: Boil a large pot of water, salted to taste. Blanch the
kale for 3 minutes. Remove with a sieve. Discard kale water.  In
the same pan, fry sweet corn with garlic or green onions.  Mix in
the drained kale, and continue cooking until all the water is
evaporated.

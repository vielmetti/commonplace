# Waldorf Salad

Apples, celery, walnuts, maybe grapes cut small if you
have them.

Winter apples are not ideal - you want them to be crunchy -
but if all you have is winter apples, by all means use them
here.

The dressing is simply lemon or lime juice or apple cider vinegar
plus mayo.

Stir to combine.

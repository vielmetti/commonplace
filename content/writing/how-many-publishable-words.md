title: How many words a day?
---
Here’s a thought experiment. Sit down in the morning with a cup of
coffee and a list of topics. Work through them, one at a time,
coming up with and writing down 500 words or so on each topic. How
many topics do you get to over the course of the day, and how long
does it take you to write 500 words that make sense? Assume for the
sake of argument that there’s a typical number of distracting email,
Twitter, and Facebook posts that you have to deal with. Each of the
pieces that you are writing will need to contemplate a part of the
net that might lead to its own distractions.

I am always impressed by people who have the ability to sit down
and crank out clean copy that is ready for publication. It’s not
by any means easy to do this, and certainly every written work can
be improved by judicious editing. I’m thinking more of the remarkable
skill where you can type as fast as you can for a short burst and
have the resulting words make sense, flow nicely, and be worth
posting to the world.

The practice I get doing this has a lot to do with blogging, where
I want to capture the moment and some momentarily interesting topic
and put my mark on it. This is not writing a novel, and not writing
a little piece of a 20-page or 400-page non-fiction work; rather,
it’s somewhere between journalism and blogging. The work you are
composing is temporarily interesting to a number of people in part
because it has a good headline for Twitter and a body full of words
that search engines like. You’ve written news, but it’s within the
context of a blog, and because of that it’s perfectly acceptable
to leave questions unanswered and stories unresolved. It’s what
musician Michelle Shocked called the “incomplete image”, and perhaps
you are waiting for someone with a longer deadline to write up the
full story.

I know from experience that I can put together 500 words in a sitting
on one topic without taking a break and without needing to consult
an outline. The much more challenging part is making a long, coherent
single narrative out of these intermediate pieces parts. The skill
of impromptu essay writing is by no means the same as the skill of
book writing, and the task of challenging yourself to come up with
a story that moves the current understanding a bit forward is a
challenge.

To some degree, I’m willing to pad out those words with ample
quotations from other sources, a sort of journalistic cut-and-paste
that sifts through less well known sources to string together a
story. (Of course the excerpts are carefully hyperlinked to avoid
any suggestion of use without attribution.) Careful reuse of existing
copy is one of the qualities that blogging can take advantage of
that isn’t generally OK in journalism circles.

If all you wrote were impromptu essays for the net, you’d quickly
find out what was a keeper by the traffic you were able to draw in.
On a good day, I’m happy to write three or four blog posts that
either satisfy my own interest in preserving a bit of news or that
advance some larger story or that answer a question that’s on more
than one person’s mind right now. That would translate into 2000
words on a good day, and that doesn’t sound like a lot. I think
you’d have to work hard to keep the hopper full of article ideas
and to keep up the research that fed a constant stream of ideas to
work from, and to work doubly hard to collect the sort of essay-sized
chunks that would eventually tell a story that’s longer and more
carefully planned.
